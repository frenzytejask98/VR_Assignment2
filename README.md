# VR_Assignment2

This was the second assignment of the course where we focus on image keypoints and their descriptors. We mainly focus on Bag of Visual Words SIFT, SURF and RANSAC.<br>
We did a horse vs bike classification where the accuracy shot upto 94.5% with just traditional ML algorithms like Logistic Regression and LinearSVM. <br>
We also did a multiclass classification using the same methods on CIFAR-10 dataset.<br> 
The Panorama directory will help you to make a panorama using multiple pictures of a place.<br>
